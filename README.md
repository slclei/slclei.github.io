## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Starting from Aug 7th, 2020, after reunion with familiy, this website will be used to record my steps in CS. I have tried several projects in github previous to test whether I am good at coding or not. After 1 year's study, I believe I like coding and plan to go further.

## Database

Starting from [Build A simple Database with C](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/), by C. No changes from [my version](https://github.com/slclei/simple-database), but with my understanding in readme.

Second one is [Dagoba: an in-memory graph database](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/dagoba-an-in-memory-graph-database.html), by JavaScript.

Learning from [CS6400](https://github.com/slclei/Lei/tree/master/OMSCS/DataBase).

## Network Security
Learning from [CS6262](https://github.com/slclei/Lei/tree/master/OMSCS/SecurityOfNetwork).

## Build website and app with JS
Build a [Frontend framework](https://mfrachet.github.io/create-frontend-framework/). During projects in Network Security, I found that JavaScript is a funny language. Therefore, I plan to learn React and JS with building a frontend framework. My own work for frame is [here](https://github.com/slclei/MyFrontendFrame). 
Learning React from [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), with my own work in [here](https://github.com/slclei/LearnReact).

First site is a [tic-tac-toe](https://slclei.github.io/Lei/web/ticGame/index.html). 

## Contour with Python

This is a [python script](https://github.com/slclei/contour_python) to plot contour with designed data.
