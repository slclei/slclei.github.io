## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Starting from Aug 7th, 2020, after reunion with familiy, this website will be used to record my steps in CS. I have tried several projects in github previous to test whether I am good at coding or not. After 1 year's study, I believe I like coding and plan to go further.

## Database
